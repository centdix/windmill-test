## Debugging Information

### AI Response Content:

```
The bug where AI Chat fails with Rust scripts and the Deepseek model likely stems from the specific content and structure of the language context generated for Rust.

Here's a breakdown of the investigation:

1.  **Frontend Context Generation**: The file `frontend/src/lib/components/copilot/chat/core.ts` contains a function `getLangContext` that generates a detailed context string for various programming languages. For Rust, this context is particularly verbose and includes specific formatting for `main` function structure, dependency management using `//! \`\`\`cargo` comments, and async handling.

    ```typescript
    // Relevant Rust context from frontend/src/lib/components/copilot/chat/core.ts
    case 'rust':
        return `The user is coding in Rust. On Windmill, it is expected the script contains at least one function called \`main\` (without calling it) defined like this:
    \`\`\`rust
    use anyhow::anyhow;
    use serde::Serialize;

    #[derive(Serialize, Debug)]
    struct ReturnType {
        // ...
    }

    fn main(...) -> anyhow::Result<ReturnType>
    \`\`\`
    Arguments should be owned. Make sure the return type is serializable.

    Packages must be made available with a partial cargo.toml by adding the following comment at the beginning of the script:
    //! \`\`\`cargo
    //! [dependencies]
    //! anyhow = "1.0.86"
    //! \`\`\'
    Serde is already included, no need to add it again.

    If you want to handle async functions (e.g., using tokio), you need to keep the main function sync and create the runtime inside.
    `
    ```

2.  **Backend AI Proxy**: The backend code in `backend/windmill-api/src/ai.rs` handles proxying requests to various AI providers, including Deepseek.
    *   It correctly identifies Deepseek and uses the API endpoint `https://api.deepseek.com/v1`.
    *   It constructs the request based on configurations (API key, etc.).
    *   Crucially, for providers like Deepseek that typically use standard API key authentication (parsed as `AIResource::Standard`), the backend does *not* modify the core JSON payload by adding a `user` field (the `add_user_to_body` function is skipped in this case). This means the raw chat messages, including the Rust context from the frontend, are passed through.

3.  **Deepseek API Interaction**: The Deepseek API, while aiming for OpenAI compatibility, might have stricter parsing rules, lower token limits for certain parts of the prompt, or sensitivities to the complex formatting present in the Rust context (e.g., the `//! \`\`\`cargo` block). When the backend forwards the request containing this detailed Rust context, Deepseek's API likely encounters an issue parsing or processing this part of the prompt and returns an error.

4.  **Error Propagation**: The backend's `proxy` function captures any error response from the AI provider (Deepseek in this case), extracts the error message, and returns it as an `Error::AIError`. This error is then received by the frontend, leading to the observed error popup.

**Conclusion**:

The most probable cause of the bug is that the specific structure, length, or special characters (like `//!` or nested backticks) within the Rust language context generated by `frontend/src/lib/components/copilot/chat/core.ts` are incompatible with what the Deepseek API expects or can handle. This leads to an API error from Deepseek, which is then displayed to the user.

Other languages like TypeScript and Python work because their respective contexts generated by `getLangContext` are simpler and do not contain such complex, potentially problematic formatting.

To resolve this, the Rust-specific context string in `frontend/src/lib/components/copilot/chat/core.ts` might need to be simplified or adjusted, particularly the parts involving `//! \`\`\`cargo` comments, when the target AI provider is Deepseek. Alternatively, if Deepseek provides detailed error messages, inspecting the exact error returned by their API would pinpoint the problematic part of the prompt.
